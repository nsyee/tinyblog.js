Installing Erlang on MacOSX using MacPorts

<p>Let's install Erlang/OTP R13B03(latest ver. at 2010/1/1) on MacOSX 1.5.8. I used MacPorts because the Erlang package on MacPorts is updated in latest.</p>
<br>
<pre class="brush:shell">
%port info erlang
erlang @R13B03 (lang, erlang)
Variants:             darwin_10, nohipe, ssl, universal

Description:          Erlang is a programming language designed at the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory. Open-source Erlang is being released to help encourage the spread of
                      Erlang outside Ericsson. We are releasing free of charge: The entire source code of the current Erlang system. Extensive libraries of code for building robust
                      fault-tolerant distributed applications. All with documentation. All the above software has been battle tested in a number of Ericsson products, for example the
                      new Ericsson ATM switch.

<p>You may see a build error. wxWidgets(and smpeg) seems an
its cause.</p>

<p>As a result of googling this, I get that wxWidgets2.8.9 registed on MacPorts seems to have a build failure. So, download a Portfile of wxWidgets2.9.0 and patch-textctrl.diff from <a href="http://trac.macports.org/ticket/20952">Ticket #20952</a>, and install them as a local ports. See the instruction of installing Local Portfile at <a href="http://lapangan.net/darwinports/index.php?HowTo/LocalPortfile">here (Japanese)</a>.</p>

<p>If you can install wxWidgets2.9.0, It is also sure to succeed to install erlang package with retrying "sudo port install erlang".</p>
